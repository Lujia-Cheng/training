1. Describe the problem generics address.
   A: Generics address the problem of having to write the same code multiple times for different types.
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
   A: `List<string> list = new List<string>();`
3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
   A: Two, one for the key and one for the value.
4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
   A: False.
5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
   A: `Add()`
6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
   A: `Remove()` and `RemoveAt()`
7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
   A: By using angle brackets after the class name. `class MyClass<T> { }`
8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
   A: False
9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
   A: True.
10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to
    A: True.
